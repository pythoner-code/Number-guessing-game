I built this game with python.
"""  Guessing Game Challenge
Let's use while loops to create a guessing game.

The Challenge:

Write a program that picks a random integer from 1 to 100, and has players guess the number. The rules are:

If a player's guess is less than 1 or greater than 100, say "OUT OF BOUNDS"
On a player's first turn, if their guess is
within 10 of the number, return "WARM!"
further than 10 away from the number, return "COLD!"
On all subsequent turns, if a guess is
closer to the number than the previous guess return "WARMER!"
farther from the number than the previous guess, return "COLDER!"
When the player's guess equals the number, tell them they've guessed correctly and how many guesses it took!
You can try this from scratch, or follow the steps outlined below. A separate Solution notebook has been provided. Good luck!

First, pick a random integer from 1 to 100 using the random module and assign it to a variable
Note: random.randint(a,b) returns a random integer in range [a, b], including both end points.

Next, print an introduction to the game and explain the rulesÂ¶

Create a list to store guesses

Write a while loop that asks for a valid guess. Test it a few times to make sure it works.

Write a while loop that compares the player's guess to our number. If the player guesses correctly, break from the loop. Otherwise, tell the player if they're warmer or colder, and continue asking for guesses.
 Some hints:
     it may help to sketch out all possible combinations on paper first!
     you can use the abs() function to find the positive difference between two numbers
     if you append all new guesses to the list, then the previous guess is given as guesses[-2]

import random

num = random.randint(1,100)
 

print('WELCOME TO GUESS ME!')
print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100")
print("If your guess is more than 10 away from my number, I'll tell you you're COLD")
print("If your guess is within 10 of my number, I'll tell you you're WARM")
print("If your guess is farther than your most recent guess, I'll say you're getting COLDER")
print("If your guess is closer than your most recent guess, I'll say you're getting WARMER")
print("LET'S PLAY!")

guesses = [0]

while True:
      
     guess = int(input('I am thinking a number between 1 to 100. Your Guess!!\t'  ))
      
     if (guess<1 or guess>100):
           print('Out OF Bounds! Please Try Again')
           continue
      
     if guess == num:
           print(f'WOW!! YOU GOT IT CORRECTLY in {len(guesses)} guesses')
           break
                
                
     guesses.append(guess)

     if guesses[-2]:
          if abs(num-guess) < abs(num-guesses[-2]):
               print('Warmer')
          else:
               print('Colder')
               
     else:
          if abs(num-guess) <= 10:
               print('Warm')
          else:
               print('Cold')
